    "# With physical flash cards, you have a stack of cards with a problem\n",

    "# you don't get the answer right, you are shown the reverse side.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# In Math1Flash, you (supposedly a first-grader learning math) are\n",
    "# given a random arithmetic or number compare problem to answer\n",
    "# (a card is drawn from the stack of shuffled cards) and shown the\n",
    "# problem (the front side). You are given up to three chances to\n",
    "# answer correctly and then you are shown the answer (reverse side).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Examples: What is 9 x 11?  answer a number     (arithmetic)\n",
    "#           Is 10 > 16?      answer yes or no    (compare numbers)\n",
    "#\n",
    "# If you answer correctly, you are rewarded with praise.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# If you don't answer correctly, you are given up to two more\n",
    "# tries (three total) to get it right and then shown the answer.\n",
    "# Before each retry you're given a \"hint\" such as \"That's too big\"\n",
    "# or \"That's not yes or no\".\n",
    "#\n",
    "# You can skip a problem/retry by just entering \"\" instead of an\n",
    "# answer if you want to go to another question instead (or end).\n",
