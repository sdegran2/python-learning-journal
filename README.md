## A repository to document my Python learning journey

## About Me
I'm Steve DeGrange. I'm from Saratoga, Ca and want to learn how to code in Python and use GitHub and other development tools.
<br>I want to learn Python specifically for use in Data Science, as well as general programming.
<br>I have substantial previous coding and development experience but no experience in Python, GitHub, IDLE, or things like Jupiter.
  
## Goals for This Course
1. Learn the syntax and basic flow of Python programs (conditionals, loops, data structures, etc.).
2. Learn how to create, test and run the Python programs using GitHub and the Python interpreter.
3. Learn to use additional development tools such as Jupiter, Anaconda, IDLE, etc.

## My First Python Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
