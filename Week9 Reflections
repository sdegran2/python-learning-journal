## Reflections on week 9 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was the first week of a few about Python classes and objects.
Classes seem very useful and I plan to looked at our previous projects to see where they could have been used to make things better.
(Not to mention doing that wrt our midterm project was our discussion assignment).
In addition to the midterm project I also looked and and reimplemented the ShapeAreaCalculator project from one of the lab assignments.
I created four classes - Shape, Circle, Rectangle and Triangle.  I think it was easier to follow and more easily shared code between the shape processing.
