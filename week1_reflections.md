- Our class is very diverse.
<br>I think (hope) that is a good thing and will let us draw on various experiences and perspectives.
- We haven't formed any groups yet (that comes next) so I am a bit concerned how that will go.
- I don't think I will have trouble with Python per se.
<br>The syntax and controls seem analogous to C or Java.
- The fact it is interpretted rather than compiled may offer some new experiences.
<br>I don't have a lot of experience with interpretted languages except for REXX on the IBM mainframe.
- The GitHub file "markdown" controls are based on GML markup tags and pretty easy to use, at least for basics.
