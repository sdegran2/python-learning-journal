I liked the conversion assignment, especially the binary number to decimal number part. It was somewhat challenging and shook some of the cobwebs from my earlier coding experiences in similar languages.<br>
I tried to do a bit more than strictly needed, such as handling input errors, using while and for loops effectively, etc.<br>
I feel like I'm getting more of a handle on at least Jupyter Notebooks and I am learning to like them and the cell and mixed code and text thing. I'm thinking of trying JupyterLab but I'm not sure I understand the benefit vs. Notebooks. I'm not as good at GitHub and have mostly stopped using Google Colab in favor of Jupyter Notebooks. WRT GitHub, it seems the main value is that the files are stored in the cloud vs. on Jupyter I think they are on my local PC, but I'm not sure about that since I don't have a client on another device to see.<br>
I'm looking forward to future lab assignments although I am still a bit wary of the group aspect. Although I agree that in the "real world" you succeed or fail largely as a team, in an introductory technical course I am not sure that is best.  But I guess we shall see!<br>
