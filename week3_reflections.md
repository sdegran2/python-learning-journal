## Reflections on week 3 of Introduction to Python
#### This week I got to shake more cobwebs off my programming past.
I wrote a couple of methods for our group's madlibs programs to get input and log it<p>
and to get input lines without the trailing ```\n``` that readline() returns.<p>
IMHO readline() should have an option to not return the ```\n``` but c'est la vie.<p>
In researching madlibs things I also learned about triple quotes ```"""``` for "multi-line strings".<p>
(I know it was mentioned in our text but I hadn't picked up on it I guess.)<p>
They are useful to make source code more readable if it has a long string (such as our story).<p>
Basically, the newline character is represented by just having no more text on a source line.<p> 

#### Sharing the files in ```Google Colab``` seemed more cumbersome than I expected.
It's sharing is much clunkier than other Google things like Google Doc for instance.<p>
But we used it anyway and lived with it.<p>
I like Jupyter Notebook better than Google Colab for Python development, but have two issues with it.
1. A lack of file sharing (as far as I know); that makes us use Google Colab instead.
2. A launch window automatically opens when you start but doesn't automatically close when you end.

#### I think the group part of the class is working ok.
Nobody is unparticipating or making others do all of the project.<p>
But I'm still not so sure that the groups are really a good thing in a "101" type class, especially a technical one.<p>
I can see that it saves the professor a lot of time, reviewing and grading far fewer things.<p>
And, as I mentioned last week, before the groups formed, I agree that in the "real world" you succeed or fail largely as a team.<p>
But I think in a class like this individual effort and results should mean more than group dynamics.<p>
**My goal is to learn Python programming skills, not team skills.**
