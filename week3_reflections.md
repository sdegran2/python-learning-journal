This week I got to shake more cobwebs off my programming past.<p>
I wrote a couple of methods for our group's madlibs programs to get input and log it<p>
and to get input lines without the trailing '\n' that readline() returns.<p>
IMHO readline() should have an option to not return the '\n' but c'est la vie.<p>
In researching madlibs things I also learned about triple quotes (""") for "multi-line strings".<p>
They are useful to make source code more readable if it has a long string (such as our story).<p>
Basically, the newline character is represented by having no more text on a source line.<p> 

Sharing the files in Google Colab seemed more cumbersome than I expected.<p>
It's much clunkier than other Google things like Google Doc for instance.<p>
But we used it anyway and lived with it.<p>
I like Jupyter Notebooks better than Colab but have two issues with JN.<p>
One, the lack of file sharing (as far as I know) that makes us use Colab instead.<p>
Two, a launch window automatically opens when you start JN but doesn't automatically close when you end it.<p>

I think the group part is working ok.<p>
Nobody is unparticipating or making others do all of the project.<p>
But I'm still not so sure that the groups are really a good thing in a "101" type class, especially a technical one.<p>
I can see it saves the professor a lot of time, reviewing and grading far fewer things.<p>
And, as I mentioned last week, before the groups formed, I agree that in the "real world" you succeed or fail largely as a team.<p>
But I think in a class like this individual effort and results should mean more than group dynamics.<p>

My goal is to learn Python programming skills, not team skills.
