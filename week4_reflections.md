## Reflections on week 4 of Introduction to Python
##### The main work this week was for the ShapeAreaCalculator (Lab 4).
I think I handled it ok, putting out extra effort for error handling and messages.
##### On the quiz, I only used 13 of the 20 minutes.
I should have used the full 20 minutes better,
copying code into Jupyter Notebook and running.<br>
For example, on the valid datatype question, I could (should) have tried:
```
x = float(0.0)
y = double(0.0)
...
```
Had I done that, I would have seen that **`double`** failed.
##### Likewise, in spades, with the modulo (%) print formatting problem.
It was worth 30% of the total!
