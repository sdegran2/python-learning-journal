###
The main work this week was for the ShapeAreaCalculator (Lab 4).<br>
I think I handled it ok, putting out extra effort for error handling and messages.
###
On the quiz, I only used 13 of the 20 minutes.<br>I should have used the full 20 minutes better,
copying some of the code into Jupyter Notebooks and running.<br>
For example, on the valid datatype question, I could (should) have tried:
```
x = float(0.0)
y = double(0.0)
...
```
and I would have seen that **`double`** failed.

Likewise in spades with the modulo (%) print formatting problem, worth 30% of the total!<br>
