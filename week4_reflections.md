The main work this week was for the ShapeAreaCalculator (Lab 4).<p>
I think I handled it ok, putting out extra effort for error handling and messages.<p>
On the quiz, I only used 13 of the 20 minutes. I should have used the full 20 minutes better,<p>
copying some of the code into Jupyter Notebooks and running it.<p>
For example, on the valid datatype question, I could (should) have tried:<p>
```
x = float(0.0)
y = double(0.0)
...
```
and seen that __double__ failed.<p>
Likewise with the modulo formatting problem (which was worth 30% of the total).<p>
