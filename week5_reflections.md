## Reflections on week 5 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was about conditions, especially ```if/elif/else```
```match/case``` was done the second part of the week.
##### We merging our pieces of Lab 5 and submitted.
I did drink type entry, Harrison did cup size entry and Jasmeen did the mainline.
##### I am struggling a little on coming up with a midterm project idea. :(
