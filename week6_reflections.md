## Reflections on week 6 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was about ```while``` and ```for``` loops
##### We also worked on Lab6, a group project on computing payroll, with a new group
##### And, finally, we got our midterm project proposal blessed by the professor.
In terms of reflections, I guess two things:
1. This group has somewhat different dynamics than the first.  Nico is coming in pretty cold so I am doing the coding and he is reviewing / testing.
   I actually like that arrangement since I like programming and want to focus on leaning to code in python, not manage projects.
2. WRT the midterm proposal, inspired by my 6 year old grandson, I came up with the idea of electronic flash cards for grade 1 math.  I am proceeding apace and think I am good with the week 8 target.
3. I am not really super at presentations but ok.  I think this will be mostly a walk thru type demo with some coding discussion.  I am fine with that.  I plan to do it live and not memorex (i.e. not recorded).
