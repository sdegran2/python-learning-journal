## Reflections on week 7 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was about ```list``` and ```tuple``` variable types.
Lists are collections of items.  They don't have to be the same data type and they can change.<br>
Tuples are pretty similar except they can't be changed after creation.<br>
##### We also worked on Lab7, a group project to write a hangman game
We took the task division suggestion in the assignment write up to heart.  I am doing the first part: initialization, display of game status after each guess, and main driver code. My partner Nicolas Morle is doing the other parts.<br>
WRT displaying guess status, I could probably have just printed something like "You have missed 4 guesses." or "You have 2 misses left.".  But I decided to also try printing out a hangman stick figure that builds up as you miss more and more letters.<br>
In reading about lists and tuples, I saw there is something similar to a list called a ```set```. Sets are interesting, and useful for our hangman project, since they differ from lists in that they do not contain duplicate values and they are not in any certain order.  The ordering part is not so important here but we want to save the unique letter guesses to check against and a set seem appropriate.
##### And, finally, we worked on our midterm projects.
Mine is called ```Math1Flash```.  It is an educational activity for learning and practicing first grade math.<br>
I think I will do a live presentation instead of a video recording but maybe I will change my mind.
