## Reflections on week 7 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was about ```list``` and ```tuple``` variable types.
Lists are collections of items.  They don't have to be the same data type and they can change.<br>
Tuples are pretty similar except they can't be changed after creation.
##### We also worked on Lab7, a group project to write a hangman game
We took the task division suggestion in the assignment write up to heart.  I am doing the first part: initialization, display of game status after each guess, and main driver code. My partner Nicolas Morle is doing the other parts.<br>
WRT displaying guess status, I could probably have just printed something like "You have missed 4 guesses." or "You have 2 misses left.".  But I decided to also try printing out a hangman stick figure that builds up as you miss more and more letters.
##### And, finally, we worked on our midterm projects.
Mine is called ```Math1Flash```.  It is an educational activity for learning and practicing first grade math.<br>
I think I will do a live presentation instead of a video recording but maybe I will change my mind.
