## Reflections on week 8 of Introduction to Python
##### This week was all about giving and listening to others give midterm presentation.
Mine was on the first day (Tuesday) and was about Math1Flash.
##### I was out of practice on public speaking.
I felt a little nervous for some reason even though I knew my project inside and out.
##### But, I think I did ok and Math1Flash was done well, so I anticipate a good grade.
I did learn a lot of things about Python in the process. And, I learned some things in other people's projects, too. For example, I intend to look more into ```bytesio``` module functions.
